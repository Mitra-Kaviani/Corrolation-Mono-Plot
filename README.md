# Corrolation-Mono-Plot
Multivariant data visualization 
In this project, R is being used to develop a multivariant data visualisation technique. This technique is used to identify the data set's hidden pattern and to reduce the data set's dimension. A two-dimensional correlation mono plot of the coefficients of the first two primary components is used to highlight the connections between variables and to indicate the most important elements that explain the variation in a data set.
